        <p>During the Middle Ages, sports such as jousting, archery, and hunting were popular among European nobility. Meanwhile, in Asia and the Americas, martial arts, ball games, and horse riding competitions thrived.</p>
        <p>In the Renaissance period, interest in organized sports grew, leading to the development of more structured competitions and rules.</p>
